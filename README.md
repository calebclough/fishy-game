# Fishy Game

Created by: Caleb Clough

## Description:

This is a rendition of the arcade game "Fishy." The object of the game is for your fish (the blue fish) to
become as big as possible. The game incorporates a school of red fish of varying size swimming across the screen. To gain
size, the blue fish must "eat" fish. It "eats" fish when it touches another fish. The blue fish may only eat fish of equal 
or lesser size than it. If the blue fish attempts to eat a fish larger then it, it dies and the game is over.

The blue fish is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard and may move left, right, up, and down and any other key to stop as the user tries to get it to eat or avoid being eaten. The red fish are programed to be of random size and move with random speed on a linear path across the screen. 

The game is won when the blue fish is as long as the screen. The console will display how many total fish you ate and your maximum size. 

## Dependancies:

The all files in this respository must be unzipped into the same folder for a C++ complier to be able compile the program.
